# Binance MCP Server - Architecture and Design

## Overview

The Binance MCP Server provides access to Binance cryptocurrency exchange data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing LLM agents to fetch real-time market data. The server is implemented in Python using the official MCP SDK and requests library for API calls.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

```
binance_mcp_server/  
├── binance_api.py     # Core API interaction module  
├── commands/          # MCP command definitions  
│   ├── __init__.py  
│   ├── market_data.py # Price/order book/historical data commands  
│   └── market_info.py # Exchange info and metadata commands  
└── server.py          # Main MCP server setup and initialization
```

## Key Components

1. **Binance API Module (`binance_api.py`)**:
   - Low-level functions to interact with Binance's REST API
   - Handles HTTP requests, error handling, and response parsing
   - Pure functions for data retrieval (read-only operations)

2. **Command Modules (`commands/`)**:
   - Define MCP tools that map to Binance API functions
   - Provide clear documentation for LLM agents via docstrings
   - Organized by functional area (market data vs. market info)

3. **Server Module (`server.py`)**:
   - Initializes the MCP server and registers all commands
   - Configures server capabilities and dependencies
   - Handles client connections and protocol management

## Design Decisions

1. **REST-only Implementation**:
   - Used only REST API endpoints (no WebSockets) for simplicity and reliability
   - Each command makes direct HTTP requests when called

2. **Public Data Focus**:
   - Server focuses on read-only public data that doesn't require authentication
   - Avoids security concerns of managing API keys for private endpoints
   - Can be extended with private endpoints in the future

3. **Tool-based Interface**:
   - Exposed functionality as MCP tools rather than resources
   - Tools provide a function-like interface that's intuitive for LLMs
   - Each tool maps to a specific Binance API endpoint

4. **Structured Data Responses**:
   - Order book data is returned as a dictionary with bids/asks arrays
   - Historical data is transformed into a more usable format with named fields
   - Numeric values are converted from strings to appropriate types

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Each API function includes proper error handling
   - Descriptive error messages include HTTP status codes and response text
   - Validation for expected response format

## Future Extensions

1. **Private API Access**:
   - Add support for authenticated endpoints with API keys
   - Implement trading functionality (place/cancel orders)
   - Access account-specific data (balances, trading history)

2. **Additional Data Sources**:
   - Add support for other Binance products (futures, margin trading)
   - Implement additional market data endpoints (liquidations, funding rates)

3. **MCP Resources**:
   - Expose some static data as MCP resources with URIs
   - Implement resource subscriptions for data that changes frequently
